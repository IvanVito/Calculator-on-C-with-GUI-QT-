    | Function description | Function |
    | -------------------- | -------- |
    | Computes cosine    | cos(x)  |
    | Computes sine      | sin(x)  |
    | Computes tangent   | tan(x)  |
    | Computes arc cosine | acos(x) |
    | Computes arc sine  | asin(x) |
    | Computes arc tangent | atan(x) |
    | Computes square root | sqrt(x) |
    | Computes natural logarithm | ln(x) |
    | Computes common logarithm | log(x) |


## Function Plotting
    The calculator provides the ability to plot functions. To plot a graph, please click the "Graph" button in the main menu of the application.
    Range of values is limited from -1 000 000 to 1 000 000
    Domain is limited from -1 000 000 to 1 000 000
    The scale remains unchanged and is 1:1

## Features of the Calculator
    Zero has multiple representations:
        0 == 0. == .0 == 0.0 == .

    Explicit sign required:
        "5x" - wrong
        "5 * x" - true

    Spaces (" ") are allowed:
        "5+x" -true
        "5 + x" -true

    The calculator guarantees accuracy up to 14 digits inclusive (include field "x").
    The calculator provides only output of numbers or error ("ERROR")
    The calculator always displays 7 decimal places (except for the initial value "0").

## Calculation of Annuity or Differentiated Loan
    At the top of the main window, you can click on the "Credit Calculate" button. Here, you can calculate two types of loans: annuity or differentiated.
    Total loan amount: not exceeding 99 999 999 999 999
    Term: not exceeding 600 months
    Interest rate: 0.01 - 999.99 percent
